# Game_simonSays
**Simon Says** is a game where one player, Simon, gives commands prefaced with "Simon says" that others must follow. Commands without "Simon says" should be ignored. Players who follow incorrect commands are eliminated. The last player remaining becomes the new Simon, and the game continues.
